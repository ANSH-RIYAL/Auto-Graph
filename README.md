# AutoGraph – Enterprise AI Observability & Codebase Analysis Platform

## Overview
AutoGraph transforms complex codebases into actionable business intelligence. It automatically analyzes any codebase and generates comprehensive architecture maps with AI component detection, risk assessment, and compliance reporting - making technical complexity accessible to business stakeholders. **Particularly powerful for fintech systems requiring explainability, transparency, and regulatory compliance.**

## Project Status
Currently in **Phase 5: Advanced Integration** - Enhanced visualization and enterprise compliance features 🔄

## Key Business Value
- **AI Component Detection**: Automatically identifies and assesses AI/ML components in codebases
- **Risk Assessment**: Categorizes components by business risk level (high/medium/low)
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generates enterprise-ready reports for SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, and PCI
- **Business Context**: Provides PM-friendly metrics including business value, development status, and stakeholder priorities
- **Real-time Analysis**: Live progress tracking with drag-and-drop interface
- **Multi-format Export**: 6 different output formats for different stakeholder needs
