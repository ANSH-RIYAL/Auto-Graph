# AutoGraph – Unified Codebase Graph (BSI) & Visualization

## Overview
AutoGraph transforms complex codebases into actionable business intelligence. It automatically analyzes any codebase and generates comprehensive architecture maps with AI component detection, risk assessment, and compliance reporting - making technical complexity accessible to business stakeholders. **Particularly powerful for fintech systems requiring explainability, transparency, and regulatory compliance.**

## Project Status
Currently in **Phase 1–2 (BSI core + clustering)** – single canonical JSON graph, deterministic layout, UI filters.

## Key Business Value
- **AI Component Detection**: Automatically identifies and assesses AI/ML components in codebases
- **Risk Assessment**: Categorizes components by business risk level (high/medium/low)
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generates enterprise-ready reports for SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, and PCI
- **Business Context**: Provides PM-friendly metrics including business value, development status, and stakeholder priorities
- **Real-time Analysis**: Live progress tracking with drag-and-drop interface
- **JSON Export** only (others deferred)

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd vc-one

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment (optional)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key
```

## Usage

### Web Application (Recommended)
```bash
# Start the web application
python run_web.py

# Open your browser to: http://localhost:5000
# Upload a codebase and view the interactive graph
```

### Command Line (Legacy)
```bash
# Analyze a codebase
python -m src.main --codebase /path/to/your/codebase

# Output will be saved to /graph/ directory
```
